# Income tax rates vary hugely between countries and depend highly on other factors like earnings, martial status and so on.  Where in Europe do people pay the highest slice of their earnings to the tax man ?  According to the Eurostat organization, a single person on an average salary without children will have the highest income tax rate in Belgium - some 42.1% of his or her earnings.  Germany isn't too far behind at 41.3%.  Neighbording Danemark comes in third with 40.6 %

# During the course of 2010-12 it became evident that, out of the eighteen eurozone states, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain facing persistent negative growth prospects and increasing government debt, would find it dificult or impossible to repay or refinance their government debt without the assistance of bailout support from the Troika.

# The transfers of bailout funds were performed in tranches over several years and were conditional on the governments simultaneously implementing a package of fiscal consolidation, structural reforms, privatization of public assets and setting up funds for further bank recapitalization and resolution.
